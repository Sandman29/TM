## Description

This is the fianl project for CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Development.  This project is a prototype of a Task Managemet System.
The applications lets you Create, Read, Update(edit) and Delete Tasks and Categories.  This system is my first time working with Laravel Databases, and some desired features have not been implemented.  One such example is that there is no Pivot table connecting the relationship of between the tasks table and the categories table.  Another feature not in this app is that all user can veiw all tasks.  In a real world application, you would not want all users to view all the tasks of other users.

## Demo

The demo of this app was given in last Monday's Section class (12/14/2014)

## Details for teaching team

Be easy on me.

## Outside code

1.) I repurposed a lot of the Susan's foobooks code as foobook presented the basic CRUD operations.
2.) The UserController is a direct copy of the foobooks UserController.
3.) The package "paste/pre" has been added as a dependency, however, I don't think I used it.
4.) The package "laravel/laravel" and all of it's dependencies were used.
